# Another 3D printable Cherry Corne Case
Provided are all the STL files needed to print a corne case for your corne needs.
Simply import into a slicer of your choice and print!
# What's different about this one?
I prefer my keyboard to be "locked" into a specific angle. Both sides are tented at a 4.3 degree incline to provide a slight but relaxing typing angle.
The top mounted plate provides a fair amount of flex while not being overwhelmingly flimsy. 
# What do you need?
* 8 x 3 mm M2 flat head screws ("weight")
* 8 x 8 mm M2 Socket screws (case)
* 14 x 4 mm M2 Socket screws (plate)
* 22 x M2 Heatset inserts, I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/a16041800ux0766-Cylinder-Injection-Molding-Embedded/dp/B01IZ157KS/)
* 8 x 3M SJ5302 bump-ons
* 2 x Corne PCBS and their respective components (I used a pro micro with low profile sockets. Fitment around the usb c port may need to be adjusted depending on your pcb)
# Word of warning
Create these at your own risk! Although these base files may work for me, you may find that you will need to adjust the space around the ucbc port for your pcb.
