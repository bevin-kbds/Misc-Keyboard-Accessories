# Bevins Case Stand
Provided are all STL files needed to print a keyboard stand for your keyboard needs.<br/>
0.3 mm of clearance was given between the connector and the base. Ideally the connector should friction fit into the base so an adjustment of this value may be needed.<br/>
Print 2x Bases and 1x Connector. For best visual quality, flip on of the bases so that they are face down on the bed on opposite sides.<br/>
No required hardwire besides an optional 4x 3M SJ5302 bumpons.
